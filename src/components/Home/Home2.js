              SÄ°nce I was very little, I've been fascinated by what one can
              achieve using solely math and logic. This fascination in turn led
              me to get involved with what I think is the best way of making use
              of math in today's world:
              <i>
                <b className="purple"> Computer Science. </b>
              </i>
              <br />
              <br />
              Having graduated from one of the most historical and succesful
              universities in Turkey ,
              <br />
              <i>
                <b className="purple"> Bogazici University </b>
              </i>
              , I now aspire to become a competent Full Stack Developer with an
              emphasis on Back End development and making use of the best
              practices out there.
              <br />
              <br />
              In the near future, I also want to work on some projects involving
              Machine Learning & Deep Learning. I already have the basis in
              these areas, having familiarity with the mathematical background
              necessary and some experience with frameworks such as
              <i>
                <b className="purple"> PyTorch </b>
              </i>
              and concepts such as
              <i>
                <b className="purple">
                  {" "}
                  Deep Neural Networks and GANs(Generative Adverserial Networks){" "}
                </b>
                in particular.{" "}
              </i>
              <br />
              <br />
              Always a pleasure to get in touch with you.
              <br />
              Have a nice time wandering around.
